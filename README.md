Dear Mororola Solutions Team, 

I am writing to present the reasons why I became interested in programming and also why I decided to take part in the recruitment process to this wonderful program as Motorolaâ€™s Programming Academy is in my opinion.  

I am graduated from the University of Economic and so far, I have worked only in the finance, mainly in accounting department. This kind of work certainly has many advantages but after several years of working for the different companies I lost motivation and I do not find this job as attractive now. I definitely do not want to develop myself in this area any longer.   

After consideration I have decided to redirect my career on the different track and I channeled my energy into learning how to program computers. I believe that this is more developmental, creative, rewarding and future-oriented occupation than accounting.  

Despite the fact that I am just at the beginning of my IT adventure I am highly motivated and ready for the new challenges. I would be very happy if I could pass through the entire recruitment process and get to the program.  

Best regards, 

Klaudia Spyrlak
